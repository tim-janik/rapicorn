The Rapicorn Toolkit
====================

Rapicorn is an experimental UI toolkit.
Many things that programmers need to spell out explicitely in Gtk+ or
other toolkits are automated in Rapicorn and duplicate manual work is
reduced as much as possible.
It aims at bringing UI-design, UI-notation and UI-programming much
closer together. This is accomplished by providing a conscise way for
UI notation, that can be used directly throughout design phases and
reduces needs for UI programming to a minimum.

Cairo is planned to be used for rendering tasks, and Pango is used for
text rendering.

Existing Features
-----------------

Rapicorn supports an item hierarchy with cross-references, type safe
per-object signal emissions, a Gtk+ based blitting backend, a Pango
based text rendering backend, basic Event processing and focus handling.
It comes with a set of core widgets such as buttons, sliders, a scroll
area, table alike layout containers and widgets to paint foreground
or background elements.
It also provides an XML markup parser that allows full GUI specifications
to be written in XML, more of which is detailed here:

Building Rapicorn
=================

In order to build released tarballs, a recent version of Pango is needed.
The sources for required packages can be found at:

Pango-1.8:
	ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.6/

Rapicorn tends to hit G++ compiler bugs fairly frequently, so if you
have problems compiling the code, or get segfaults in STL source files,
upgrading the compiler may improve the situation.

Compiling with a different compiler version than the default on your system
and running all checks Rapicorn offers (they should all succeed) can be
done with command lines similar to:
  export CC=gcc-3.4 CXX=g++-3.4 CPP=gcc-3.4\ -E CPPCXX=g++-3.4\ -E
  ./configure
  make all install
  make report # report runs fast tests, slow tests and performance tests
