The Rapicorn Toolkit
====================

Rapicorn is an experimental UI toolkit.
It aims at bringing UI-design, UI-notation and UI-programming as close
together as possible. To accomplish this, it provides conscise ways for
UI notation, usable also throughout design phases.
Simple but powerful programming mechanisms are provided to automate
binding of programming and GUI logic and to minimize manual work.

Cairo is planned to be used for rendering tasks, and Pango is currently
used for text rendering. A more extensive overview is provided online:

Existing Features
-----------------

Rapicorn supports an item hierarchy with cross-references, type safe
per-object signal emissions, a Gtk+ based blitting backend, a Pango
based text rendering backend, Event processing and focus handling.
It comes with a set of core widgets such as buttons, sliders, a scroll
area, table like layout containers and widgets to paint foreground
or background elements.
It provides an XML markup parser that allows full GUI specifications
to be written in XML, more of which is detailed here:

Dependencies
============

In order to build Rapicorn from release tarballs, a recent version of
libpng, Pango and Gtk+ as well as Python 2.5 are currently needed.
The sources for the required packages can be found here:

	http://gtk.org/download.html
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/
	http://www.python.org/download/releases/

As Debian package list:

	libgtk2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libpng12-dev python2.5-dev

Rapicorn tends to hit GNU C++ compiler bugs fairly frequently, so if you
have problems compiling the code, or get segfaults in STL source files,
upgrading the compiler may improve the situation.

Compiling with a different compiler version than the default on your
system and running all checks Rapicorn offers (they should all succeed)
can be done with commands like:

  export CC=gcc-3.4 CXX=g++-3.4 CPP=gcc-3.4\ -E CPPCXX=g++-3.4\ -E
  ./configure
  make all install
  make report # report runs fast tests, slow tests and performance tests
