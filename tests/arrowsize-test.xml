  <!-- This test reconstructs auto-expanding arrows like they are used in
       scrollbars. Using center-child="0" is crucial here so the "child-area"
       alignment surrounding the arrow properly expands its child. Also
       the string to number conversion in `not 1*center_child` is crucial
       for this to work.
       The TestContainer then asserts that the arrow really is allocated with
       a width based on its height.
