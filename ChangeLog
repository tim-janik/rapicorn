Sun Sep 24 20:33:04 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/painter.hh, rapicorn/painter.cc: added drawing methods to
	draw directional arrows, trapezoid and a quadrangle.

	* rapicorn/paintgadgets.hh, rapicorn/paintgadgets.cc: removed cairo
	painter uses. added DrawableImpl, an implementation of 
	Rapicorn::Drawable.

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh: removed unused Color::blend, added
	Color::add_premultiplied().

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: define Drawable.

	* rapicorn/text-pango.cc: removed all trapezoid rendering code, use
	Painter::draw_trapezoid() instead which can render directly into a Plane.

	* rapicorn/text-editor.hh, rapicorn/text-editor.cc: moved EditorClient
	to Editor::Client.

	* rapicorn/item.hh: provide == and != operators for item references.

	* examples/tour.xml, examples/tour.cc: added a test drawable and connected
	a drawing callback to it to perform some test drawings.

	* rapicorn/Makefile.am:
	* configure.in:
	* Makefile.am: removed libpixman/libcairo library inlining.

Thu Sep 21 00:18:01 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: changed root() to get_root()
	because it too easily clashes with variable names. changed handle<>()
	to use a dynamic_cast<*> pointer cast instead of a dynamic_cast<&>
	reference cast, because the latter tends to confuse gcc-4.1. this also
	allowes us to provide a better error message if casts fail, via an
	error method that demangles the destination C++ type and using typeid.

	* rapicorn/table.hh:
	* rapicorn/layoutcontainers.hh: fixed Container type interfaces to 
	actually derive from Container.

	* rapicorn/region.*: properly unintialize regions in destructor.

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: removed useless empty frame
	from UnfocusedButton.

	* rapicorn/handle.hh: removed useless cast function.

	* rapicorn/factory.cc: slight string fix.

	* rapicorn/viewport.cc:
	* rapicorn/container.cc: added virtual destructor for class with 
	virtual methods.

	* rapicorn/evaluator.cc: sigh, added destructor to unconfuse gcc-3.4.

	* rapicorn/utilities.hh: draw in <typeinfo>.

Wed Sep 20 00:45:45 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* examples/tour.xml: scrolling test fixup.

Wed Sep 20 00:35:44 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/text-pango.cc: misc fixes.
	implemented TextPangoParser and MarkupDumper which parses and save a
	set of various text attributes of the displayed text string.
	implemented lazy color attributes for pango to defer resolving of the
	actual color values until we have a Style assigned.
	implement the Text::EditorClient interface (at least rudimentarily).
	changed TextPangoImpl to always keep its own layout and to use
	a PangoLayout as its main model (for text and attributes).
	implemented a RapicornPangoRenderer based on pangoft2 to support
	colored text, this involved copying of pangoft2-render.c trapezoid
	rendering code (LGPL).

	* rapicorn/text-editor.hh, rapicorn/text-editor.cc: introduce the
	neccessary API and structures to implement text editing.

	* rapicorn/appearance.hh, rapicorn/appearance.cc: added 
	Style::resolve_color() to map a color string to a Color.

	* rapicorn/factory.hh, rapicorn/factory.cc: turned many exceptions into
	errors, because recovery from those case was broken anyway.
	implemented "prop:"-element handling, which allows an arbitrary XML
	subtree to be used as property value. for this, the parsed XML is 
	recaptured into a string with Birnet::MarkupParser.

	* rapicorn/birnetmarkup.hh, rapicorn/birnetmarkup.cc: 
	fixed printf_escaped(). added input_name() accessor. added
	recap_element() and recap_string() to recapture an element subtree
	of the processed XML into a new XML string.

	* rapicorn/birnetutils.hh: tell gcc that error() never returns.

	* rapicorn/container.cc: removal of invisible items doesn't need
	to invalidate. keep reference to self around unparent_child().

	* rapicorn/item.cc: keep containers referenced across set_parent().

	* rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc: removed resolve_color().

	* examples/tour.xml: added more test gadgets.

	* tests/markup.cc: fixes and extensions.

Mon Sep 18 02:09:32 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: optimizd flag propagation
	to reduce exposes. fixed ::affine_from_root().
	reworked ::expose() methods to queue rectangles and regions.
	introduced ::affine_to_cousin() and ::affine_from_cousin(),
	these aren't working correctly yet though.

	* rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc: fixed frame child allocation in
	case of !m_overlap_child.

	* rapicorn/container.cc: fixed ::expose_enclosure() to not expose 
	children. made ::set_focus_child() virtual.

	* rapicorn/root.hh, rapicorn/root.cc: fixed get_focus() so containers 
	can access this from within set_focus_child(). allow enqueueing of
	expose regions.

	* rapicorn/region.hh, rapicorn/region.cc: added ::affine() to transform
	a whole region.

	* rapicorn/primitives.cc: 64bit coordinate fixes.

	* rapicorn/scrollitems.cc: minor fixes. prototyped scroll position 
	adjustment for focus child.

	* examples/scroller.cc, examples/scroller.xml: made fewer and bigger 
	test buttons which is a lot faster

Sun Sep 17 20:10:05 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

        * rapicorn/container.hh, rapicorn/container.cc: cleanups.
        for horizontal/vertical focus movement, ignore the current
        focus child and simply filter out focus children which are not
        positioned ahead according to focus direction. this simplifies
        sorting logic and fixes remaining movement bugs. never reset
        the current focus child, Root takes care of that now.
        added ::expose_enclosure() to expose a containers area without
        exposing its children, this still needs optimization.

        * rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: don't force invalidation
        when items enter or leave the focus chain. removed reset_history
        argument from move_focus(), adapted callers. removed unused flags
        INVALIDATE_ON_CHANGE and EXPOSE_ON_CHANGE.

        * rapicorn/root.cc: always unset focus child of all containers of
        the current focus chain when unsetting focus. moved focus handling to
        an extra function and fixed remaining focus movement oddities.

        * rapicorn/buttons.cc: grab focus when a button is clicked.

        * rapicorn/paintcontainers.hh, rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc:
        added Frame::overlap_child() property to control whether extra space
        is requested to draw the frame around the child. implement automatic
        exposure of frames upon ::changed. also, expose FocusFrame if its
        Client changed.

        * rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: changed Button to always be focus-able, added
        UnfocusedButton which can't accept focus. exchanged slider buttons for
        UnfocusedButton.

Sat Sep 16 21:44:47 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/rootimpl.hh, rapicorn/root.cc: removed expose rectangle 
	queue. implemented expose region handling via class Region.
	moved rendering to draw_now(). added logic to dispatch_event() to
	coalesce multiple motion events. immediately handle pending redraws
	after all events have been processed.

	* rapicorn/viewport.hh, rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: removed 
	invalidate_plane() and enqueue_mouse_moves() methods. upon processing of
	motion notify events, immediately request a new event for when the 
	pointer moves any further, and enqueue intermediate motion events from
	device history.
	prevent Gtk+ from queueing a shallow draw upon focus changes.

Sat Sep 16 03:01:26 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/region.hh, rapicorn/region.cc: added ::string() method.
	added scaling by 256 for doubles to int64 conversion. that way
	fractional values are still accounted for to some extend (up to two
	decimal digits, by 8 fractional bits) and rectangle dimensions up to
	3.6e16 are supported (55bits).

	* tests/region.cc: added tests for regions with fractional rectangle
	sizes. extended random region generation code to also yield fractional
	regions.

Fri Sep 15 23:55:33 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/item.cc (set_allocation): align allocations to integer
	quantities and constrain dimensions to values <= 2^52 to stay within
	double precision.

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh: removed ftoi(). added dtoi32() and dtoi64()
	with fixed fallback behaviour (round-to-nearest for i386 asm and the
	non-asm case). turned iceil, ifloor and iround into int64 functions.

	* rapicorn/utilities.hh: extended min/max definitions for mixed integer
	and floating point arguments to int64 and double.

	* tests/primitives.cc (math_test): test dtoi*, iround, iceil, ifloor.

Thu Sep 14 19:40:22 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh, rapicorn/primitives.cc: changed class Rect
	to provide publically accessible x,y,width,height fields. moved
	method implementations out of the class definition. adapted callers.

Thu Sep 14 00:32:44 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/factory.hh, rapicorn/factory.cc: improved error mesages, fixed
	lookup order, so parsing new files can override existing definitions.
	added Factory::ItemTypeFactory::sanity_check_identifier() to verify proper
	item types for factory registration.

	* tests/testitems.xml, tests/items.cc:
	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml, examples/tour.xml, examples/scroller.xml:
	changed syntax of newly defined identifiers to MixedCase. refer to stock
	item implementations via the Rapicorn::Factory::-namespace. fixed up
	resulting incompatibilities.

	* examples/tour.cc: use Factory::must_parse_file() to parse item definitions.

	* rapicorn/*.cc: declare new item types in the Rapicorn::Factory::-namespace.

Wed Sep 13 02:13:35 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/root.cc: move focus according to key directions, forget focus
	history when crossing beyond first/last focusable item. added beep().

	* rapicorn/container.cc: implemented next/prev and right/up/left/down
	focus direction handling. reset last focus child if no new focus was
	found, in case reset_history was requested. 

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.hh: added reset_history arg to 
	move_focus(), fixed callers. added notify_key_error().

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh, rapicorn/primitives.cc: provide Rect<->Point
	distance and contains methods.

	* rapicorn/viewport.hh, rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: added beep().

	* examples/tour.xml: minor test extensions.

Tue Sep 12 02:25:49 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/buttons.cc: provide missing move_focus() implementation.

Tue Sep 12 01:48:51 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/container.hh, rapicorn/container.cc: implemented item cross 
	link handling. uncross links between descendants upon unparentation.
	implemented keeping of focus child history. implemented recursive
	hirarchical focus movement. the current implementation just provides
	"next" movement according to the containers child order, but it gets
	the basics right.

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: introduced a FOCUS_CHAIN flag
	which is set on the current focus item and all its toplevels.
	added move_focus() method. added viewable() test method to figure
	whether an item is visible with its parents.
	added common_ancestor() method and cross_link(), cross_unlink()
	and uncross_links(). added toplevel_interface(), similar to
	parent_interface(). allow containers to hook into unparenting.
	introduced virtual can_focus() method for item type implementations
	to decide on focus-ability.

	* rapicorn/root.hh, rapicorn/rootimpl.hh, rapicorn/root.cc: added focus
	item handling, move focus in response to key presses. added invalidation
	handling by triggering an async resize handler. 

	* rapicorn/viewport.hh, rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: added a flag to 
	set_config() to force delivery of WIN_SIZE and WIN_DRAW events.
	allow the rapicorn viewport widget to get focus and try to grab the
	default gtk focus.

	* rapicorn/paintcontainers.hh, rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc:
	added FocusFrame::Client struct for containers to derive from,
	to take notion of a child focus frame.

	* rapicorn/buttons.cc: added support for focus frames to buttons, so
	that a button containing a focus frame as descendant accepts focus.

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: minor button definition fixups.

Tue Sep  5 01:59:55 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/enumdefs.hh: added FocusDirType.

	* rapicorn/paintcontainers.hh, rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc:
	added FocusFrame with implementation, to change frames depending
	on focus state.

	* rapicorn/utilities.hh: misc cleanups.

Tue Sep  5 00:11:40 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/text-pango.cc: removed useless Affines. added cursor 
	rendering prototype code.

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: define label in terms of Rapicorn::TextPango.

	* rapicorn/pangolabel.hh, rapicorn/pangolabel.cc, rapicorn/Makefile.am:
	removed PangoLabel.

	* examples/tour.xml: removed useless frames. added insensitive label.

Tue Sep  5 00:07:29 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/text-pango.hh, rapicorn/text-pango.cc: label -> text rename.

Tue Sep  5 00:03:38 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/text-pango.hh, rapicorn/text-pango.cc: CVS copied from 
	pangolabel.hh and pangolabel.cc.

Mon Sep  4 19:54:55 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/adjustment.hh, rapicorn/adjustment.cc: fixed default adjustment
	values to [0..100] with proper stepping and page==0. fixed clamp logic to
	preserve stepping in the presence of page==0.

	* rapicorn/slider.cc: avoid duplicating adjustment setup defaults.

Wed Aug 30 19:27:10 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/scrollitems.cc: implement ScrollPortImpl::child_affine() to
	account for the scrolling area offset, and the rendering offset.

	* rapicorn/item.*, rapicorn/container.*, rapicorn/root.*:
	fixed up item/child coordinate handling by introducing ::child_affine()
	which provides a parent<->child translation matrix. this affects event
	processing, expose handling and item intersection tests via ::point().

	* rapicorn/events.hh, rapicorn/events.cc: provide 
	create_event_transformed() which copies an existing event and adjusts
	coordinates and dimensions according to an affine matrix.

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh, rapicorn/primitives.cc: provide h/v expansion
	for affines as well as == and !=.

	* tests/primitives.cc: fixed HSV test cosmetics. started testing Affine.

	* examples/scroller.xml: added upper-left lightning ambience to
	scrollable area.

Wed Aug 30 02:04:48 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/region.hh, rapicorn/region.cc: const fixes.
	allow implicit constructor conversions. s/is_empty/empty/.
	added cmp(). renamed containment tests. added contains() also
	for regions. renamed add/subtract/interset/exor.
	added operators for ==, !=, <.

	* rapicorn/regionimpl.h, rapicorn/regionimpl.c: fixed debugging prints.
	removed miRegionReset() and resurrected miRegionNotEmpty() and
	miRegionEmpty() because the former does odd NULL fiddling which
	the latter seem to get right. fixed up empty modified regions to
	always contain a 0-size extents rectangle at 0,0.
	fixed up invalid pointer accesses that the compiler didn't catch.
	fixed up euqlity handling of empty regions. implemented
	_rapicorn_region_cmp() and _rapicorn_region_region_in().
	relaxed coordinate order constraints on rect_in, fixed empty
	rect handling. 

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh: s/is_empty/empty/, changed callers.
	const fixes. added == and != to Rect. 

	* rapicorn/item.hh: const fixes.

	* tests/region.cc: added test code for regions.

Tue Aug 29 01:42:57 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/region.hh, rapicorn/region.cc: added class Region which
	represents a list of non-overlapping rectangles. it supports union,
	subtract, intersect, xor, point_in and rect_in operations. the
	rectangles are stored at 64bit integer precision, not at double
	precision which the API might suggest in places.

	* rapicorn/regionimpl.c: edited to support 64bit integer coordinates,
	edited to avoid symbol exports and to enable compilation of a
	standalone version of this file. added rapicorn C API wrapper
	functions.

	* rapicorn/regionimpl.h: provide rapicorn C API wrapper prototypes
	for rapicorn/regionimpl.c.

Mon Aug 28 23:14:46 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/miregion.c: added contents of mi/miregion.c from the
	xorg-server-X11R7.1-1.1.0.tar.bz2 tarball, license "AS IS", as long as
	the copyright disclaimer is retained.

Sun Aug 27 23:05:10 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/factory.cc: canonify custom argument names.
	expand property and pack-property values before applying them.
	this allowes general $... value expressions in gadget XML files.

	* examples/scroller.xml: 
	* examples/scroller.cc: supply buttons labels with a text containing the
	row/col pair.

Sun Aug 27 18:01:08 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/factory.hh, rapicorn/factory.cc: added input_name,
	line_number and location() to gadget structure to enable proper
	error messages. removed internal Environment and replaced its
	uses by Evaluator. more canonicalization fixups.
	changed argument/property handling so that they either address item
	properties, pack properties or custom arguments (via "<arg:.../>").
	lists of unused argumnets/properties are now explicitely maintained,
	and proper error() messages are now generated for invalid argument
	names (including file+line number of the corresponding gadget
	definition).

	* rapicorn/evaluator.hh, rapicorn/evaluator.cc: added canonify(), 
	extended populate_map() and added replenish_map().

	* rapicorn/properties.cc: use '_' as delimiter to canonify property names.

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: added try_set_property() to spare
	an extra lookup to figure whether a property exists before setting it.

	* rapicorn/container.cc: reworked add()/add_child() mechanism so that
	pack properties are now applied automatically, and so that a list of
	unused (invalid) pack properties can be returned from add().
	optimized Packer::apply_properties() to require only a single commit
	for multiple properties.

	* rapicorn/tableimpl.hh, rapicorn/table.cc:
	* rapicorn/layoutcontainers.cc:
	* rapicorn/arrangement.cc: removed/cleaned up add_child() implementations.

	* rapicorn/birnetmarkup.hh, rapicorn/birnetmarkup.cc: introduced
	line_number_after_newline flag to adjust line numbers used for errors
	and get_position() if it refers to a statements right before a recently
	parsed '\n'. added input_name field for more descriptive messages.

	* examples/tour.xml: removed bogus pack properties.

	* examples/scroller.cc: fixed up add_button_row() to set only known properties.

	* tests/markup.cc: adapt to MarkupParser().

Sat Aug 26 00:25:56 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/root.cc: discard WIN_SIZE and WIN_DRAW events if more 
	WIN_SIZE events are pending. this makes resizes much snappier.

	* rapicorn/events.hh, rapicorn/events.cc: changed string_from_event_type()
	to return const char* instead of a temporary string which seems to make
	problems with varargs calls.

Fri Aug 25 23:52:31 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* examples/scroller.cc: removed layout caching, since PangoLayout 
	caching only has negligible performance effects. PangoContext is
	still in place though, and is very important memory wise.

Fri Aug 25 19:05:07 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/pangolabel.cc: rewrote to plug layout/context leaks and to
	cache initialized structures to a certain extend. code cleanups.

	* rapicorn/viewport.hh, rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: alloc gtk locking from
	other code portions.

	* examples/scroller.xml: test text fixup.

Fri Aug 25 02:38:48 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/layoutcontainers.cc: fixed up excessive column/row creation in
	hbox and vbox.

	* rapicorn/table.cc: minor optimizations to is_row_used() and is_col_used().

	* rapicorn/factory.hh, rapicorn/factory.cc: added create_container().

	* examples/scroller.cc, examples/scroller.xml: new test program to stress 
	scroll area implementation.

Thu Aug 24 21:53:32 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/container.hh, rapicorn/containerimpl.hh, rapicorn/container.cc:
	changed add_child() to not return a bool but report errors via exceptions.
	fixed item leak in case of exception, impro ved exception messages.

	* rapicorn/factory.cc: fixed up attribute canonification which broke
	property settings.

	* rapicorn/tableimpl.cc:
	* rapicorn/table.cc:
	* rapicorn/layoutcontainers.cc:
	* rapicorn/arrangementimpl.hh:
	* rapicorn/arrangement.cc: fixed up add_child().

Wed Aug 23 23:06:07 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/evaluator.hh, rapicorn/evaluator.cc: new support class for
	Rapicorn::Factory to evaluate simple expressions and handle variable maps.
	implemented standard boolean operators, numeric comparators, string
	comparators. println and count. added builtin variables $RAPICORN_VERSION,
	$RANDOM and $RAPICORN_ARCHITECTURE.

	* rapicorn/factory.cc: support argument declarations "arg:*" for gadget
	definitions. fixed element canonifcation to allow '_' in element names.
	use Evaluator canonification for variables/attributes, which mandates
	'_' as word delimiter. error out on invalid elements instead of throwing
	a warning.

	* rapicorn/birnetutils.hh, rapicorn/birnetutils.cc:
	extended string_to_bool(), added errmsg(), extended number of strings
	supported by Exception().

	* rapicorn/container.cc, rapicorn/factory.cc: improved error and
	exception messages.

	* tests/evaltest.cc: test Evaluator funcitonality such as variable
	expansion and function evaluation.

	* configure.in: define RAPICORN_VERSION, RAPICORN_PACKAGE_VERSION.

Tue Aug 22 19:54:35 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/scrollitems.cc: constrain both adjustments before thawing
	them individually. fixed missing member variable prefixes. make sure
	all pending exposes have been processed before calling copy_area().

	* rapicorn/item.cc: unset POSITIVE_ALLOCATION in set_allocation() so
	items are !drawable() while size_allocate() is called.

	* rapicorn/adjustment.hh, rapicorn/adjustment.cc: fixed value comparisons
	upon thaw(), so all possible changes between freeze() and thaw() are now
	accounted for. exported ::constrain() to anticipate the value validation 
	usually executed by thaw(). 

	* examples/tour.xml: extended scrollable text.

Mon Aug 21 01:58:52 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/adjustment.hh, rapicorn/adjustment.cc: fixed nvalue() to 
	respect page() size, same for abs_range(). added abs_length(), to relate
	page size to range.

	* rapicorn/rapicorn.xml: expand/spread sliders so they grow with 
	adjustment page() size changes.

	* rapicorn/slider.hh, rapicorn/slider.cc: changed inner trough layout
	so that v/h-spread children will expand up to the trough borders, and
	h/v-expand children will be expanded according to the page size.

	* rapicorn/scrollitems.hh, rapicorn/scrollitems.cc: make sure to round
	adjustment quantities to nearest integers, since we can't scroll onto
	fractional pixel boundaries. use area copying and differential area
	exposes when scrolling now, which immensely reduces the re-rendered
	areas.
	freeze h/v adjustments before updating both values in scroll_to(), so
	x+y changes are handled "atomically".
	adjust step and page increment upon size_allocate(), to allow fast
	stepping over the scrollable region and fast paging relative to the
	viewport size.
	pre-paint scrollable region in background color, since area copying
	requires a homogeneous background.

	* rapicorn/item.hh, rapicorn/item.cc: added copy_area() which wraps
	clips to the child allocation and wraps Root::copy_area().

	* rapicorn/root.hh, rapicorn/root.cc, rapicorn/rootimpl.hh: added
	copy_area() and draw_now() methods to implement fast scrolling.
	added extra lock to protect the event queueand main loop, to avoid
	deadlocks when being called from viewport methods (in extra thread). 
	call Viewport::enqueue_mouse_moves() to receive new mouse events once
	movement events have been processed. lowered expose event handler
	priority, so input event processing has a higher priority now.

	* rapicorn/viewport-gtk.hh, rapicorn/viewport-gtk.cc: added copy_area()
	for fast on-device copies of viewport areas. added enqueue_win_draws()
	to allow immediate processing of invalidation areas. added
	enqueue_mouse_moves() to request new motion event generation.
	disabled IdleBlitter code, we're always blitting full planes immediately
	now, though this hampers responsiveness on remote displays, it is
	neccessary for area copying (which relies on all prios blits to be
	completed).

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh, rapicorn/primitives.cc: added using directives
	for overloaded functions. added minor speedups to plane filling by using
	memset4() when possible. added Color argument to Display::create_plane()
	and Plane() to spare unneccessary 0-fills.

	were both unused.

	* rapicorn/enumdefs.hh: added AdjustmentSourceType for AdjustmentSource.

	* rapicorn/primitives.hh, rapicorn/primitives.cc: made Plane copy
	constructor and assignment operator private, because this class
	does not support copying semantics. reworked plane creation
	functions to avoid copy constructor dependecy.

	* rapicorn/paintcontainers.cc:
	* rapicorn/pangolabel.cc: fixed plane creation.

	* rapicorn/slider.hh, rapicorn/slider.cc: added adjustment_source

Sat Jul  8 20:55:12 2006  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* rapicorn/table.cc, rapicorn/tableimpl.hh: changed shrinking logic so
	we start shrinking columns/rows in the center of a table. also, if not
	enough shrinkable columns could be found, shrink all columns/rows by
	an amount proportional to their size, starting from the center.
	this makes resizes beyond the requisition feel much more natural, since
	we now make the best effort to avoid shrinking artefacts and we do our
	best to provide important controls at window/table edges (like menubars
	or buttons).

	at least for the first 3 size allocations (basically, this allowes
	flexible resizing algorithms which to converge from an initially unstable
	to a stable state later on, similar to simulated annealing).
	added logic to dispatch WIN_DELETE events.

	* rapicorn/enumdefs.hh: added SizePolicyType. 

	* rapicorn/events.cc: added WIN_DELETE event.
